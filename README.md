-This is my Rock, paper, scissors project, and in the readme I'm gonna write down all the steps that I'm going to go throug on finishing the project.

The first part goes by creating the index.html and and script.js files.

Firstly, in the index.html I'm gonna write down the html:5 template where I'm gonna put the script option where I link the script to the html file.

Then I start doing the Javascript part, starting by puting in the variable called options the three options of the game.
In the getComputerChoice function, I've created the variable choice where I have my variable options chosen randomly using math.floor and math.random.
